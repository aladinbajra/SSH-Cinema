**_Framework_**:
TypeScript offers many benefits over JavaScript, but the primary one is the static typings it adds to the language. This addition gives us more certainty over the code we write and helps reduce the number of bugs and issues that are created.

**_Database_**:
MongoDB is faster and more scalable. It is an open source, nonrelational database management system (DBMS) that uses flexible documents instead of tables and rows to process and store various forms of data.

**_Object Data Modeling(ODM)_**:
Mongoose manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.
It is implemented in backend folder, inside the src folder named as mongooseConn.js.
